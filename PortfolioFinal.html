            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm incredibly interested in software development as well as game design. I've had the passion for a
                while now,
                and I'm planning on turning it into a career. I've always been interested and impressed by computers and
                how they work,
                along with how websites and games are created. I taught myself how to build a computer and followed
                countless tutorials
                to learn how to create a unity project, which acts as a game. About a year before entering this program,
                I built a
                semi-functional vr game that I named "Weeping Winter" that took place in a dark and snowy forest. It had
                functional movement,
                tracking, and a monster that moved around the map until it finds the player. Different audios would play
                depending on what surface the player touched, and
                the monster had sounds it would make depending on its state (idle or aggro'd). I abandoned the project
                because I deleted something I shouldn't have,
                and it broke everything. Catapult reignited my love for unity, and I decided to use both my previous
                skills with unity combined with the html and css skills I learned.
